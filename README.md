<summary> My Tech journey </summary>
before joining the CFG Degree Spring course I actually never wrote code before. for years before I was always put off
as I thought it looked complicated. Early December I was encouraged to give it a try and I started by researching
and reading basic guides on python. this then developed a passion and made me look for ways to pursue education further.
