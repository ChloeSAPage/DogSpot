<summary> My Tech journey </summary>
before joining the CFG Degree Spring course I actually never wrote code before. for years before I was always put off
as I thought it looked complicated. Early December I was encouraged to give it a try and I started by researching
and reading basic guides on python. this then developed a passion and made me look for ways to pursue education further.

I did my degree in Microbiology, and during that time I did one coding project. When I graduated and entered the working world, I realised I didn't really enjoy the practical work of a laboratory, so I decided to take up some Python courses which lead me here!

  <summary> My Tech journey </summary>

I studied Accounting & Finance at uni, but after beginning my first full-time job I realised I was interested in taking on more technical work and so I started to teach myself to code. I discovered Code First Girls and completed the 8-week SQL course which I loved. This then led me to apply to the nano degree to continue my coding journey and I am hoping this will lead me to my first job as a software engineer.

## About our project

The primary aim of our project was to create a user-friendly website to help dog owners find dog-friendly locations. The platform addresses the growing need for reliable information about places where dogs are welcome, allowing owners to include their furry friends in their daily activities and travels.

We have created a search functionality that allows users to find dog-friendly locations based on a given location. We integrated the Yelp API to provide the dog-friendly establishments with additional information such as reviews, opening hours and contact hours. We also integrated the Google Maps API to provide the user with directions to their chosen location.

The inspiration for this project stemmed from the noticeable increase in dog ownership during the COVID-19 pandemic. With many individuals working from home or being furloughed, people looked towards dog adoption for companionship. However, more recently the world has returned to normalcy and lots of people have busy schedules. This has resulted in a struggle between balancing dog care with daily responsibilities. There is a growing need for solutions that enable dog owners to integrate their dogs into their lifestyle.

Our website aims to provide a solution to this problem by providing users with dog-friendly locations. The website has a simple user interface that is easy to use to ensure a seamless user experience. This solution encourages responsible dog ownership as well as mitigating issues related to dog abandonment by making it easier for dog owners to include their dogs in their activities.
