## About our project

The primary aim of our project was to create a user-friendly website to help dog owners find dog-friendly locations. The platform addresses the growing need for reliable information about places where dogs are welcome, allowing owners to include their furry friends in their daily activities and travels.

We have created a search functionality that allows users to find dog-friendly locations based on a given location. We integrated the Yelp API to provide the dog-friendly establishments with additional information such as reviews, opening hours and contact hours. We also integrated the Google Maps API to provide the user with directions to their chosen location.

The inspiration for this project stemmed from the noticeable increase in dog ownership during the COVID-19 pandemic. With many individuals working from home or being furloughed, people looked towards dog adoption for companionship. However, more recently the world has returned to normalcy and lots of people have busy schedules. This has resulted in a struggle between balancing dog care with daily responsibilities. There is a growing need for solutions that enable dog owners to integrate their dogs into their lifestyle.

Our website aims to provide a solution to this problem by providing users with dog-friendly locations. The website has a simple user interface that is easy to use to ensure a seamless user experience. This solution encourages responsible dog ownership as well as mitigating issues related to dog abandonment by making it easier for dog owners to include their dogs in their activities.
