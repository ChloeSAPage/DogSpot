<summary> My Tech journey </summary>
before joining the CFG Degree Spring course I actually never wrote code before. for years before I was always put off
as I thought it looked complicated. Early December I was encouraged to give it a try and I started by researching
and reading basic guides on python. this then developed a passion and made me look for ways to pursue education further.

I did my degree in Microbiology, and during that time I did one coding project. When I graduated and entered the working world, I realised I didn't really enjoy the practical work of a laboratory, so I decided to take up some Python courses which lead me here!

```
API_KEY = "" (for the yelp API key)
GMAP_API_KEY ="" (for google maps api key)
